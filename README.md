# Lead-Scoring-Model
In this project, I imported the necessary libraries and mounted the drive. Then, I inspected the data and checked for duplicate values, and dropped unwanted columns. I performed data cleaning by imputing null values with the mode and changed the values to categories of each column. I used one-hot encoding to represent categorical data.

Furthermore, I addressed the issue of unbalanced data using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). I implemented two models: Random Forest and XGBoost. I evaluated the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and found that the XGBoost model performed better.

In conclusion, I successfully developed a machine learning model to predict lead scores, which can be used to prioritize leads and improve the conversion rates of businesses.
